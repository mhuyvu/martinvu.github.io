I am an Organizational Health Economist and an Assistant Professor of Management at [The University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/). My research centers around workforce management and organizational performance with a specific focus on the role interpersonal relationships play in maximizing performance. In  my [job market paper](https://stschwab.github.io/images/JMP_2023.04.06.pdf) I studied the effects of discontinuity in primary care on patient utilization and outcomes. I have a PhD in Managerial Science and Applied Economics from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business and Master's degrees in health and business administration from Baylor University.  

 I am also a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel with over 21 years of professional and leadership experience. I served as the Chief Financial Officer of [Brooke Army Medical Center](https://bamc.tricare.mil/About-Us), a level one trauma center and the Department of Defense's largest hospital. I also served as the Chief Financial Officer for the [Walter Reed Army Institute of Research](http://www.wrair.army.mil/), the Department of Defense's largest biomedical research laboratory. I continue to partner with the Military Health System and [the Geneva Foundation](https://genevausa.org/) to advance military medicine through research, development, and education.
