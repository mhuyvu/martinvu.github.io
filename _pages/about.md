I am a health economist specialising in the economics of genomic and precision medicine. I am a health economist specialising in the economics of genomic and precision medicine. I conduct health economic research to inform policy and regulatory decisions around genomic sequencing in clinical care and population use. 

Since June 2024, I am based at the Health Economics and Policy Research Unit at the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph/). At Queen Mary, I am predominantly involved in two major research projects:
1. The Generation Study: My work with the Generation Study is to assess the impact of genomic newborn screening on healthcare resource use and costs, quality of life outcomes and non-health-related outcomes, to inform the Genomics England health economics model.
