HiI am a health economist specialising in the economics of genomic and precision medicine. My work focuses on using economic research to inform policy and regulatory decisions around genomic sequencing in clinical care and population use. 

Since June 2024, I have been based at the Health Economics and Policy Research Unit at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Queen Mary University of London. Here, I evaluate the costs and benefit (both health and non-health) of using genomic sequencing in newborn screening for rare, treatable genetic conditions in 100,000 babies (the Generation Study). I am also conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis of clinical metagenomics for diagnosing and treating infectious endocarditis as part of the AMetIP-IE trial.I am an Organizational Health Economist and an Assistant Professor of Management at [The University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/). My research centers around workforce management and organizational performance with a specific focus on the role interpersonal relationships play in maximizing performance. I have a PhD in Managerial Science and Applied Economics from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business and Master's degrees in health and business administration from Baylor University. 

 I am also a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel with over 21 years of professional and leadership experience. I served as the Chief Financial Officer of [Brooke Army Medical Center](https://bamc.tricare.mil/About-Us), a level one trauma center and the Department of Defense's largest hospital. I also served as the Chief Financial Officer for the [Walter Reed Army Institute of Research](http://www.wrair.army.mil/), the Department of Defense's largest biomedical research laboratory. I continue to partner with the Military Health System and [the Geneva Foundation](https://genevausa.org/) to advance military medicine through research, development, and education.
