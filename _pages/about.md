I am a health economist specialising in the economics of genomic and precision medicine. I am a health economist specialising in the economics of genomic and precision medicine. I conduct health economic research to inform policy and regulatory decisions around genomic sequencing in clinical care and population use. 

Since June 2024, I am based at the Health Economics and Policy Research Unit at the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph/). At Queen Mary, I am predominantly involved in two major research projects:
1. [The Generation Study](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/champp/generation-study-process-and-impact-evaluation): My role in the Generation Study involves evaluating the impact of genomic newborn screening on healthcare resource utilisation and costs, quality of life outcomes, and broader non-health-related outcomes. This work supports the development of the Genomics England health economics model.
2. [The AMetIP-IE trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06309680): I am conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of clinical metagenomics with standard blood cultures for the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis.

I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne in 2023, where I focused on the economic impact of genomic sequencing in managing blood cancers. Before that, I worked as a Research Fellow at Cancer Health Services Research, leading projects on the health system impacts of complex genomic sequencing. I have also evaluated pharmaceutical submissions for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee at the Department of Health and Aged Care.
