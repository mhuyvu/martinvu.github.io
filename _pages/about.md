Welcome to my web site! I am an organizational health economist affiliated with Baylor University Department of Economics. My research centers around the impact of organizational structure and strategy on the cost and quality of care. In  my [job market paper](https://stschwab.github.io/images/Schwab%20(2021)%20Value%20of%20Specific%20Information.pdf) I study the effects of discontinuity in primary care on patient utilization and outcomes. I have a PhD in Managerial Science and Applied Economics from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business and Master's degrees in health and business administration from Baylor.  

 I am also an active duty Army Lieutenant Colonel with over 20 years of professional and leadership experience. I currently serve as Chief Financial Officer of [Brooke Army Medical Center](https://bamc.tricare.mil/About-Us), a level one trauma center and the Department of Defense's largest hospital. I was previously the Chief Financial Officer for the [Walter Reed Army Institute of Research](http://www.wrair.army.mil/), the Department of Defense's largest biomedical research laboratory. I am retiring from the military and will be on the 2022-2023 economics job market.
